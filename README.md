This is a simple HTTP server I made to better understand Rust and HTTP.

The repository is public only for sharing purposes. Nothing here is stable.
If you are looking for production-ready libraries, check out:

- [http](https://github.com/hyperium/http) - types for dealing with HTTP requests (similar to `http_lib` crate in this project)
- [hyper](https://github.com/hyperium/hyper) - a low-level HTTP server library
- [actix-web](https://actix.rs/) - an actor-based HTTP server framework
